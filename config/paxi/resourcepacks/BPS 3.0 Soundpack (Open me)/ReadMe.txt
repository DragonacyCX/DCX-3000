If you here, then you probably want to get a compatibility between Epic Knights and Sword Blocking Mechanics.
I don't know how to do this automatically using resourcepack, so you need to do this manually until I will find the solution.
1) Open mods folder
2) Find Sword Blocking Mechanics mod .jar
3) Open it using 7Zip, WinRAR or any other archiver
4) Go this way: data ---> swordblockingmechanics ---> tags ---> items
5) In items folder you will find can_perform_sword_blocking .json file - delete it
6) Return to folder that contains such folders as META-INF, data, assets, some useless .json files and other crap
7) Open BPS 3.0 Sound Pack ZIP archive (you're already here lmao)
8) copy data folder into sword blocking mechanics .jar
9) Voila, you have established compatibility between mods!
